### password-generator
This is my password generator built with a little bit of HTML and CSS but mainly powered by JavaScript. The purpose of this application is to create a completely random custom password based on user input. When the generate password button is pushed, a user is then faced with a series of prompts to help customize their new password. The user can customize the length, use of upper and lower case letter, use of special characters, and use of numbers. After all the input is gathered the new password is formed and displayed inside the text area. The program creates all the possible outputs for a desired password and stores them in an array. Different parts of the array are called upon to create the password based upon the users selections. This project was very challenging for me as it was my first experience in JavaScript and I ran into many road blocks along the way. However, the program works great and I'm pretty proud of it.
